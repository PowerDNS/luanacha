# Lua-Monocypher  - *(work in progress!!)*

This is intended to be a Lua wrapper for the Monocypher cryptographic library by Loup Vaillant (http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/monocypher/).

Monocypher is heavily based on the NaCl crypto library by Daniel Bernstein and Tanja Lange.

Major features and differences with the NaCl library:

* Authenticated encryption with Chacha20 stream encryption and Poly1305 MAC,
* Curve25519-based key exchange and public key encryption,
* Blake2b hash function,
* Ed25519-based signature function using Blake2b hash instead of sha512,
* Argon2i, a modern key derivation function based on Blake2b.

The complete documentation of the Monocypher library is available at http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/monocypher/manual

Note:  As of February 2017, Monocypher is not deemed to be production-ready yet. (See section "Current state" at http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/monocypher/)
